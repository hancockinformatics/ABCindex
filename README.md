## About

ABCindex is a tool to quantify and visualize the *in vitro* effects of drug 
combinations. The Anti-Biofilm Combination Index (ABCI) is a metric designed
to assess drug combination therapy in checkerboard assays, without relying on
activity thresholds (e.g. MIC, MBIC, or MBEC), which present significant 
challenges when evaluating antibiofilm activity.


## Availability

ABCindex is available at: https://travis-m-blimkie.shinyapps.io/ABCindex/. Note
that it is still under development; features and functionality are subject to 
change.


## Help

For information about how to use ABCindex, and details on the calculation of 
ABCI values, see the Help pages on the website. If you encounter a bug or 
other issue, please submit an issue here on GitHub. 


## Contributors

ABCindex was developed by Travis Blimkie and Lucas Pedraz at the 
[CMDR Hancock Lab](http://cmdr.ubc.ca/bobh/). A big thanks to all the testers, 
especially Noushin Akhoundsadegh and Evan Haney.
