## About

ShinyABCi is a tool to quantify and visualize the *in vitro* effects of drug 
combinations. The Anti-Biofilm Combination Index (ABCI) is a metric designed
to assess drug combination therapy in checkerboard assays, without relying on
activity thresholds (e.g. MIC, MBIC, or MBEC), which present significant 
challenges when evaluating antibiofilm activity.
