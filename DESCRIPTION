Description: ABCindex is a tool to quantify and visualize the in vitro effects
  of drug combinations. The Anti-Biofilm Combination Index (ABCI) is a metric 
  designed to assess drug combination therapy in checkerboard assays, without 
  relying on activity thresholds (e.g. MIC, MBIC, or MBEC), which present 
  significant challenges when evaluating antibiofilm activity.
