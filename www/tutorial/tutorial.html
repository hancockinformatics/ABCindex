      Interpretation and visualization of checkerboard assays using ShinyABCi
    </h1>

    <h4 class="mt-4">1. Prepare your data for ShinyABCi</h4>
    <p>
      ShinyABCi takes any form of checkerboard assay data (e.g., crystal
      violet, TTC) in the same format produced by microplate readers. Data can
      be provided as direct measurements (absorbance, fluorescence) or relative
      measurements (percentage of untreated or relative to an external control).
      ABCI was designed for antibiofilm activity data but can be used for any
      kind of checkerboard assays, including planktonic experiments (see the
      ABCI calculations tutorial for more information).
    </p>
    <p>
      We provide input templates in .xslx or .ods  format. The only necessary
      preprocessing step is blank subtraction: if it has not been performed by
      the microplate reader software, please subtract the blank before
      uploading your data.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can upload different experiments as sheets in the input file; they
      will become different panels in the final graph. Each experiment can have
      any number of replicates, which must be provided as individual tables
      within the same sheet separated by at least one blank row. Not all
      treatment concentrations need to be represented in every replicate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data must include untreated wells (concentration = 0) . Do not include in
      the input any wells that are not intended to be plotted in the final
      graph (e.g., blank wells, external controls).

    <h4 class="mt-4">2. Prepare your data for ShinyABCi</h4>
    <p>
      Click <b>"Upload plate data"</b> and select an .xlsx or .ods file
      formatted as detailed above. An input preview will appear to the right of
      the screen detailing the treatment in the rows and columns of each of your
      experiments, as well as the different concentrations included. Make sure
      everything looks OK and click "Perform ABCI calculations". If the
      preview does not reflect your intended input the most likely reason is a
      mistake in the input file; try downloading the template and copying and
      pasting your data onto it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Afer clicking "Perform ABCI calculation, a dialog window will appear with
      two options for data normalization. By default, ShinyABCi will assume your
      data is direct observations (e.g., absorbance units or relative
      fluorescence units) and convert them into percentages relative to the
      average of the untreated wells (both concentrations equal to zero). This
      is the <b>"Normalize my data"</b> option. If you have already converted
      your data to percentages (for example, to make them relative to a growth
      control consisting of multiple wells per plate) select <b>"My data is
      already normalized"</b> instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you've made the appropriate selection, click "Calculate ABCI values",
      which will perform the analysis and take you to the "Results" tab.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">3. Create ShinyABCi plots</h4>
    <p>ShinyABCi lets you visualize two types of information:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Drug interaction (Anti-Biofilm Combination Index)</b>. Positive
        values indicate a drug combination that, at the given concentrations,
        presents higher antimicrobial activity than any of the individual drugs
        on their own (additive or synergistic behaviour). Negative values
        indicate a combination with worse activity than at least the best of the
        individual drugs (antagonism). See the ABCI calculations tutorial for
        more information.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Antimicrobial activity (percentage of biomass killed)</b>. Depending
        on the type of experiment this may have different biological
        interpretation, such as biofilm inhibition or biofilm eradication.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The recommended plot for ShinyABCi results is the <b>dot plot</b>, which
      depicts both ABCI values (as colours) and antimicrobial activity (as dot
      sizes). You can also use <b>tile plots</b> to only represent ABCIs; in
      that case, we recommend choosing the drug concentrations you are most
      interested in and represent their antimicrobial activity in a <b>line
      plot</b>. Dot and tile plots are available in <b>split</b> versions that
      separate the positive and negative ABCI values into two different plots,
      for visual simplicity.

    <p>
      Choose the type of plot you want and click <b>"Create or update the
      plot"</b>. You can use the options below to modify the plot and click
      "Create or update the plot"" again to confirm the changes. Hover over
      the "?" next to each option to read an explanatory tooltip.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can download the plot by right-clicking on it and selecting
      <b>"Save image as..."</b>
